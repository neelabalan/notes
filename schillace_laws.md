1. Don’t write code if the model can do it; the model will get better, but the code won’t.
2. Trade leverage for precision; use interaction to mitigate.
3. Code is for syntax and process; models are for semantics and intent.
4. The system will be as brittle as its most brittle part.
5. Ask Smart to Get Smart.
6. Uncertainty is an exception throw.
7. Text is the universal wire protocol.
8. Hard for you is hard for the model.
9. Beware pareidolia of consciousness; the model can be used against itself.
