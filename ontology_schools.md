| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summary  | The world is 'real,' and science proceeds by examining and observing it | The world is real, but it is almost impossible to examine it directly | Scientific laws are basically created by people to fit their view of reality | Reality is entirely created by people, and there is no external 'truth' |
| Truth    | There is a single truth                                                 | Truth exists, but is obscure                                          | There are many truths                                                        | There is no truth                                                       |
| Facts    | Facts exist, and can be revealed through experiments                    | Facts are concrete, but cannot always be revealed                     | Facts depend on the viewpoint of the observer                                | Facts are all human creations                                           |
