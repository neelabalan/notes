Professor Brailsford delves further into the era of mainframe computing with this hands-on look at punch cards.  Extra Material on Punch Cards: http://youtu.be/lkSGMrH5Kic Extra Material - behind the scenes: http://youtu.be/Wi326Leuemg  Mainframes to Unix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rPPqm44xLs Near to the Metal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNuFVq5QeRk  Addendum: "ICL punched cards actually have 12 rows -- not 11 as stated in the film. Choosing any two hole positions out of 12 gives 66 combinations -- which can represent 66 different characters. This in turn is more than enough for the 64 possibilities of a 6-bit character held in ICL computer memory.

NOTE ONE: This was filmed at YouTube HQ in San Bruno. It was filmed before the much-discussed changes were made to YouTube comments section - we have not asked questions about that.  NOTE TWO: This is a Computerphile video - it was NOT made by YouTube or reflect the company's official views. Staff were kind enough to answer some of our questions (well, most of them), but they did not edit the video or "approve" it - any mistakes in the editing or animations are most likely our own.  NOTE THREE: A video about the YouTube algorithm (how videos are recommended) is coming soon to Computerphile - so you really should subscribe.  NOTE FOUR: The snowboarder is Sean!

P vs NP in The Simpsons and Futurama. Featuring author Simon Singh. http://simonsingh.net  Simon on Numberphile: http://bit.ly/SimonSinghPlay  Clarification: NP actually stands for non-deterministic (or nondeterministic) polynomial. Simon did us a favour by speaking off-the-cuff on this topic and it is our fault for not cleaning up things in the edit. However Simon's (excellent) book covers this in more detail (pages 157-159 in hard cover) and, in it, he opts for nondeterministic without the hyphen.  http://www.facebook.com/computerphile https://twitter.com/computer_phile  Film by Sean Riley and Brady Haran.

To give you an idea of the change from before, here are a few minutes showing the relative boot times. This laptop is Sean's own machine which had largely fallen into disuse. Originally bought as a video editing machine in 2006 with successive updates and patches to XP Media Centre Edition, it had become slow enough to make him want to throw it through the nearest window each time he asked it to do a task! - Now, with an inexpensive SSD installed it is his machine of choice....

|[Reverse Polish Grows on Trees - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrfcJCulsF4)                                       |Why use Reverse Polish Notation? How does it relate to trees in Computer Science? Professor Brailsford explains how RPN arises naturally, as a linearized form of a tree.   For further research, the Prof suggests you seek out material on the topics of "Postorder Tree Traversal" and "Dijkstra's Shunting Yard"   Correction: In the graphic at 06:30, on the illustration of the second tree, the A is incorrectly labelled as a C.

|[Undecidability Tangent (History of Undecidability Part 1) - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsZsd5qtbo4)           |What was the first undecidable problem? Professor Brailsford takes us on a computerphile tangent & gives us his angle on a pre-computer example of undecidability.  Note from Professor Brailsford: a couple of corrections for this film: 1/ "... early 18th Century" for Gauss should be " ... early 19th century"  2/ "... 100 years ago" for Newton should be "... 100 years before Gauss  3/ The Greek word I was struggling with was "Boeotians". I have now taken expert advice which tells me that the "oe" is pronounced "ee" as in "Oedipus". Hence a reasonable approximation to the correct pronunciation is "Bee-oh-shuns"  4/ In my excitement to get the message across I sometimes refer, in the video, to Euclid's 5th axiom being a "proposition". However it is more accurately a "postulate" i.e. something which should be provable from the other axioms/postulates of the Euclidean system. The fact that it can't be thus proved means that the other axioms are insufficiently powerful to prove it -- hence it is "undecidable" within that axiom system."

|[Free Software (made with free software) - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaJ7vUu1ixg)                             |Why the Free Software Foundation say iTunes isn't free software. Matt Lee, Technical Lead at Creative Commons explains.  Swim Tracking App: http://youtu.be/-UxBdVirvJs  UTF8 & the Unicode Miracle: http://youtu.be/MijmeoH9LT4  The Kindle Text Problem: http://youtu.be/kzdugwr4Fgk How this film was made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS7hXuO2UKE  A version of this film made with Avid (proprietary software): http://youtu.be/nXYly_wnAT4   This film was produced (almost) entirely with free software. The exception is that I transcoded the original footage to an easier to handle format before I started. The project has taken a week & involved me trying no less than five distros, several types of video editing software and spending hours waiting for renders which most of the time failed. I found a way of working which still took five hours to export from the editing software, in pieces, it was then pieced together by mkvmerge and uploaded.  There are some production issues with this film, such as glitchy audio and some harsh cuts, but they are partly down to my inexperience with the specific editing software and lack of patience and not necessarily purely to the software itself.   Thanks for reading this footnote - next step is to pull together a film on how I made this one!

The continuity is all over the place as I filmed some of this while in the process of making the last film and some of it after the film was published – watch my beard miraculously grow and be shaved & grow again as the film goes on, see night become day and day become night...

Sean Comments/Questions (For those who can't hear him clearly) 11secs: "This was the hill climbing algorithm?" 2min 40sec: "recently with Professor Brailsford we did the idea of The Turing Test, so that strikes me from what you're saying that that's a very specific domain: pretending to be a human talking?" 4min 2sec: "is that like 'humans have been changing the world to meet their needs?' " 4min 40sec: "but on a bigger scale, as you say on a grander scale, building a dam, and er irrigating a field, and putting a pipe to your house and allowing you to have a tap {fawcett} is doing the same thing but on a grander scale." 6min 39sec: "all these dimensions, if you try to brute force infinite dimensions you're gonna fall over pretty quickly?" 6min 45sec: "change the world" (in ref to him picking up the drink!)

Dr Steve Bagley explains.  The graphic showing where sector holes were read is incorrect. Sector hole was seen where Dr Bagley showed. Earlier 8 inch floppy disks had different standards for hard sector disks, some at the hub, some near the outside of the disk- which is what the graphic was trying to illustrate.

CORRECTION : Richard refers to 750 Pokémon being available,he confused total Pokémon (722 according to Wikipedia July 2016) with those available in the game ("more than a hundred" according to Pokémon.com July 2016)  Why does Pikachu sometimes pop up in inappropriate places? 'Phone zombies' glued to their devices at major landmarks, are probably playing Pokémon GO.

Dr Mike Pound explains how it works.  Fire Pong in Detail: https://youtu.be/ZoZMMg1r_Oc  Deep Dream: https://youtu.be/BsSmBPmPeYQ  FPS & Digital Video: https://youtu.be/yniSnYtkrwQ   Dr. Mike's Code:  % This script is the one mentioned during the Computerphile Image % Segmentation video. I chose matlab because it's a popular tool for % quickly prototyping things. Matlab licenses are pricey, if you don't have % one (or, like me, work for an organisation that does) try Octave as a % good free alternative. This code should work in Octave too.  % Load in an input image im = imread('C:\Path\Of\Input\Image.jpg');  % In matlab, K-means operates on a 2D array, where each sample is one row, % and the features are the columns. We can use the reshape function to turn % the image into this format, where each pixel is one row, and R,G and B % are the columns. We are turning a W,H,3 image into W*H,3  % We also cast to a double array, because K-means requires it in matlab imflat = double(reshape(im, size(im,1) * size(im,2), 3));  % I specify that initialisation shuold sample points at % random, rather than anything complex like kmeans++ initialisation. % Kmeans++ takes a long time if you are using 256 classes.  % Perform k-means. This function returns the class IDs assigned to each % pixel, and in this case we also want the mean values for each class - % what colour is each class. This can take a long time if the value for K % is large, I've used the sampling start strategy to speed things up.  % While KMeans is running, it will show you the iteration count, and the % number of pixels that have changed class since last iteration. This % number should get lower and lower, as the means settle on appropriate % values. For large K, it's unlikely that we will ever reach zero movement % (convergence) within 150 iterations. K = 3 [kIDs, kC] = kmeans(imflat, K, 'Display', 'iter', 'MaxIter', 150, 'Start', 'sample');  % Matlab can output paletted images, that is, grayscale images where the % colours are stored in a separate array. This array is kC, and kIDs are % the grayscale indices. colormap = kC / 256; % Scale 0-1, since this is what matlab wants  % Reshape kIDs back into the original image shape imout = reshape(uint8(kIDs), size(im,1), size(im,2));  % Save file out, you need to subtract 1 from the image classes, since once % stored in the file the values should go from 0-255, not 1-256 like matlab % would do. imwrite(imout - 1, colormap, 'C:\Path\Of\Output\Image.png');   http://www.facebook.com/computerphile https://twitter.com/computer_phile  This video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.

John Linfield takes us through the kit.  Corrective Comment: The Sony 2K monitors, as used at Swanwick/Prestwick, are not vector graphics displays. The PDP11/34s were more than a 'graphics card' they were Radar Display Processors which handled selection of the required radar data streams from the 12 odd available and also handled the inputs from the various control panels on the controller suite. The 11/34s originally drove as Sector Equipment Group which converted the digital data to vector data to drive the original displays, once the Ericsson displays where introduced they had the SEG functionality built in and were therefore driven directly by the 11/34.

|[Sorting Secret - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcJHkWwjNl4)                                                      |Two different sorting algorithms are actually the same. Professor Graham Hutton explains.   Note from Professor Hutton: It's great to see all the discussions here! To clarify a point raised in some of the comments, the video shows that if you consider the essential underlying idea of selection sort and insertion sort, in terms of how they decompose the problem of sorting, then they perform the same operations but in different orders. Using the picture in the video, selection sort proceeds column at a time and insertion sort proceeds row at a time, but they both perform the same 'triangle' of operations in the end. A particular implementation of these sorting methods may optimise the process in some way, e.g. in a sequential implementation each row can stop comparing numbers once the point of insertion is found. But this is an implementation detail that is dependent on the computational model used, such as sequential versus parallel, or imperative versus functional, rather than part of the essential means by which the sorting methods work.

|[The Blockchain & Bitcoin - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcuc3rgwZAE)                                            |Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies bringing together Merkle trees, Hashing & Distributed Architecture. Christopher Ellis explains.  Note1 - At 6:46 when Chris is drawing the Merkle Tree, C would actually be duplicated and hashed with itself not with B. So you would get H(C - C) instead of H(B - C).   Note2 - At minute 17, Christopher mentioned the mining reward halving at 21,000 bitcoins but meant 210,000 blocks.

|[Triple Ref Pointers - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZEX_l0DFK0)                                                 |The 'magic' trick of pointers to pointers - Professor Brailsford explains how what might seem complicated will actually simplify your code. (See Extra Bits video for a code walkthrough)  The Professor's Code: http://bit.ly/Computerphile_ProfBrails_TripleRef  EXTRA BITS - Triple Ref Code: https://youtu.be/1s0w_p5HEuY   n.b. Message from the Prof: Many thanks to all of you who have pointed out that I got over excited at the end of this video and (on the LEGO model) did the pointer reassignment in the wrong order. The correct way ( in the model once again) was to do the short pointer first and the longer pointer second - which I think is done correctly in the downloadable C program.   http://www.facebook.com/computerphile https://twitter.com/computer_phile  This video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.
