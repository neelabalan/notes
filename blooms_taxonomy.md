# Bloom's taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, & Krathwohl, 1956) is one of the most recognized learning theories in the field of education.


Bloom's Taxonomy comprises three learning domains: the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor, and assigns to each of these domains a hierarchy that corresponds to different levels of learning. 

- Cognitive - This is about our mental skills and how we think. It involves learning new information, understanding it, remembering it, and being able to use it effectively.

- Affective Domain - This area deals with our emotions and attitudes. It's about how we feel towards learning and how we can manage those feelings to learn better. 

- Psychomotor - This focuses on physical skills and actions. It's about using our bodies to learn new things, which could be anything from simple reflex actions to complex movements requiring precision and planning.
